Implementation of Metamath in F# for the sake of learning its internals.

`main.fsx` holds the entirety of the language, which comes to around 330 LOC.

The work on this is done for the time being. I've implemented the significant majority of the language and tested it on some toy examples by hand, but I'll leave thoroughly testing it on the whole library along with implementing proof decompression for later if I ever get back to this.
